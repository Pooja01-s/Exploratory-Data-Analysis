Exploratory Data Analysis of Titanic Passenger Data
Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic passenger dataset to understand the key factors that influenced passenger survival. The analysis focuses on data cleaning, visualization, and extracting meaningful insights from the data.

Objective
To explore and understand the structure of the Titanic dataset
To identify patterns and trends related to passenger survival
To gain insights that can support future predictive modeling

Dataset
Source: Seaborn Titanic Dataset
Description: Contains passenger information such as age, gender, class, fare, and survival status.

Tools & Technologies
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn

Project Steps
Data Loading – Loaded the Titanic dataset using Seaborn
Data Cleaning – Handled missing values and removed irrelevant columns
Exploratory Data Analysis
Univariate analysis (single variable analysis)
Bivariate analysis (relationship between two variables)
Multivariate analysis (correlation study)
Data Visualization – Used plots to understand survival patterns
Insights – Summarized key findings from the analysis

Key Insights
Female passengers had a higher survival rate than male passengers
Passengers in higher classes were more likely to survive
Younger passengers showed slightly better survival chances
Fare and passenger class were correlated with survival



✅ Conclusion

This EDA project provided valuable insights into passenger survival patterns on the Titanic. The findings from this analysis can be used as a foundation for building machine learning models for survival prediction.
